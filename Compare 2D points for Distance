Compare 2D points for distance from origin:


White a program to check distance of 2D points from origin and print the point with highest distance.

Create class Point with attributes as below:

double x

double y

In Solution class, define main method to reed values for three point objects.

Next, create below method in Solution class which will take three point objects as input parameters and return the point with highest distance from origin.

public static Point pointWithHighest Origin Distance(Point pl, Point p2, Point p3)

Consider sample input as below to read values for six point objects

4 223377

Output:

-4.0

-4.0
